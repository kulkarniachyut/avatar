2018 Hack Week project for Creating and Personalising ebay customers
Buyer Experience using Machine Learning 
Problem : 

1) Average age of a user on eBay website - 55 years old 
2) Review system is almost non-existing 
3) A place for people where to share interests about products, sellers - does not exist 
4) The UI/UX is not appealing for the millenials

Solution : 
Using machine learning techniques like 
1) Collaborative Filtering 
2) PCA 
3) Clusters 
4) Neural Nets 

We are proposing a completely new idea where every user is "personified" by his past and current purchases, searches and other actions on eBay website. 

Gamification of UI- A concept introduced where every action of the user is rewarded and incentivized so as to make buying an exciting experience 

Also provide a platform to interact with other buyers, sellers through a moderated community for each of the Avatars
